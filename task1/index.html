        <h3>Repairs Over Replacement</h3>
        <p>
          We approach every aspect of our business with sustainability in mind.
          That's why we believe it's always worth trying to fix a system before
          outright replacing it, wherever possible – it requires fewer materials
          and is easier on the planet, as well as your wallet! If another
          company tells you that your system needs to be replaced, just give us
          a call and we'll see if we can repair it first.

          <p>
            We're here to help you with solar panel installation in Devon and
            Cornwall. If we were to sum ourselves up in a few words, those would
            be "reliable, honest and friendly." We find our customers agree!
            We're with you from the start of the project to the finish.

          <h4>Price</h4>
          <p>
            As I'm sure you'll have seen, solar systems don't tend to come
            cheap. Our aim is to make solar power accessible to everyone, so we
            price ourselves in a way that makes solar energy more affordable.
            We're focused on helping you and on helping the environment, rather
            than on turning a profit.
          </p>

        <div>
          <h4>Sustainability</h4>
          <p>
            As we've said, we do this because we truly care about the planet and
            about seeing people embrace a greener, more eco-friendly approach to
            power. The world of green energy can be jargon-filled and opaque, so
            we want to help educate people on the big and little things they can
            do to protect our planet!
